# Pyweb

A protoype for a completely new python based web ecosystem.

## Installing/running

### Browser

If you want to try the browser, you have to clone the repository first.
Then install the dependencies and run the browser.py file.

This was tested only on linux.
And this guide will get more detailed when the browser gets more stable and usable

### Server

Run the server.py file in the server directory. ðŸŽ‰

## Browsing

**The next and previous buttons don't work yet!**

You just type the url in the address bar.

There are two types of addresses:

### Local file

It works like in any other browser. You type `file://` and then your file path.

E.g.
```
file:///home/user/Documents/index.wpym
```

### Remote file

It works like in any other browser, with the exception that the protocol is `wpyp(s)` instead of `http(s)`.

E.g.
```
wpyp://localhost/
```
